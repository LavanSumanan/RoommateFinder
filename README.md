## Dioscura: The Roommate Finder

# Why we made it
- As incoming university students, we've faced the struggle of finding a suitable roommate
- Other options exist, like university's themselves giving you a roommate, messaging people on social media, or letting fate decide, but our platform gives university students a chance to meet others looking for roommates who have similar needs and lifestyles. You'll never have to deal with a crappy roommate for months after using our site!

# How it works
- Users visit our site and fill out a quick and easy form
- Dioscura uses a Flask backend and FireStore database to store the user input, calculate their roommate personality type, search through other users, and find matches
- Dioscura returns those matches to the user on their screen, and in the future it will provide them an opportunity to chat on the site before deciding to become roommates or share personal contact information

# How to use it
- Visit the site
- Fill out the form
- Find your match!
